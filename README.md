# Metacrafters Intermediate EVM course challenge 2

This project demonstrates a basic funding smart contract with front end integration using raw HTML & JavaScript. It comes with a contract, front end integration, and a script that deploys that contract.

Do the following:

clone the repo and run
```shell
yarn (or) npm i
yarn hardhat node
```
In a new terminal,
```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
Then copy the contract address and paste it in constants.js file in FrontEnd folder.
Now run the front end and interact with the smart contract.
